Keeps all passwords in file encrypted with gpg using AES256.

To create the file initally, or edit it later,
    ./polygonus <encrypted file> --edit

to find a section:
    ./polygonus <encryted file> <word>

Sections are blocks of text seperated by empty lines:

    section
    test in this
    block is shown when
    a match anywhere in
    it is found
    
    but not this one if
    it's not found in 
    here

I find a handy alias is

    alias project_passwd="$HOME/projects/polygonus/polygonus $HOME/projects/project_passwds/passwords.txt.gpg"
